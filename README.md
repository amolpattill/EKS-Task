Here I'm going to share my EKS(elastic Kubernete service) task which has been given by Vimal Daga sir, related to one of the most popular and great service of AWS cloud

Amazon elastic Kubernete service is fully managed Kubernete service with high availability, security and Serverless option

Task:-
Create mysql database and Drupal on the top of EKS cluster

In this assignment I have deployed my whole infrastructure through yml code which makes my work easy. For creating EKS cluster I'm using cluster.yml file which will create this cluster just in one click within 15-20 minutes also I'm using EFS(elastic file system) to make my mysql database persistent

Here we can also use fargate cluster which is a Serverless program through this we can launch ec2 instance on demand

In this just two days training of AWS EKS i have learned alot and it helped me to increase my confidence. All thanks to Vimal Daga sir for providing us such kind of training
